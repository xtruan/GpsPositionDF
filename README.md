# GPS Position Data Field
GPS Position Data Field for Garmin ConnectIQ - https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/ea5a1da7-b72d-4e1e-97cf-5ee0e38bdf31

Simple data field to display current position information in a variety of different formats which are configured in Garmin Connect/Garmin Express settings. UTM/USNG/MGRS positions are using NAD83/WGS84 datum. Each "page" is cycled through on a 5 second interval. This can be changed to 10 seconds in settings.

***NOTE 1: GPS must be turned on first by going to Settings - Sensors - GPS

***NOTE 2: This is a Data Field, not an Application. Please see the documentation for your device to see how to enable data fields.

Tested on simulator for all supported devices and on Forerunner 55 and vivoactive hardware.

Changelog:
* 3.0 - Initial release as a Data Field. For the Application version, see: https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/12097123-2f57-4d59-afd7-2887c54c0732
